recup tableau[y][x] = z

struct t_pt3d 
	int	x  //actually float better?
	int	y
	int	z
	t_pt3d	*next_r //right
	t_pt3d	*next_d //dow

actually can separate the poiny part, easy to just make an N points by 2 array of inds that point to!

pt3_arr = malloc (sizeof t_pt3d * ny * nx )
while y < dernier
	while x < dernier
	pt3_arr[nx * yy + xx].x = 
						 .y = 
						 .z =
						 .nxt_r = &pt3_arr[" + 1]
						 .nxt_d = &pt3_arr[" + nx]
	dernier x nxt_r =NULL
				nxt_d same

dernier y
while (x < dernier)
	nx_r = +1
	nx_d = NULL
dernier x et y
both null

make copy of struct to apply rotation and projection
(by passin val instead of address shld work?)

no need to go down to 2D, jusk skip the z val?
