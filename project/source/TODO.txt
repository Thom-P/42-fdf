- add auto rescale z, and auto return to iso/ini

- install valgrind and check leaks
- replace destroy and create window by writing black pixels to see if faster?`
(probably not bottle neck, not many pix)
- replace dup fmat at each render (only do once at beginning and update mat each time)
- how to make parsing faster?
