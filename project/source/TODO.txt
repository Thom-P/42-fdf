- implement color? based on z value? or slope angle?
- rework condition of point inclusion in image before drawing (optimize by checking each point only once) 
can create a bool array to check whether or not included
- can pre-compute neighbors for edge tracing
- bonus...
- need to understand if have to free all alloc vars when 1 malloc fails
- install valgrind and check leaks
- replace destroy and create window by writing black pixels to see if faster...
