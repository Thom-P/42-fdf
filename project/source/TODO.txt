- gather Rotx and Rotz in one 3x3 mat
- implement zoom by diag matrix to mult in above one
- implement z scaling by scaling matrix element 
- implement color? based on z value? or slope angle?
- implement translation... where?
- rework condition of point inclusion in image before drawing (optimize by checking each point only once) 
can create a bool array to check whether or not included
- can pre-compute neighbors for edge tracing
- bonus...
