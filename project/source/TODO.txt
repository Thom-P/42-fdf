- add auto rescale z
- work order in which segments are drawn, from back to from...(would need sort algo of pts based on z value)
- bonus...
- install valgrind and check leaks
- replace destroy and create window by writing black pixels to see if faster?`
(probably not bottle neck, not many pix)
- replace dup fmat at each render (only do once at beginning and update mat each time)
- how to make parsing faster?
